name: loop-until-done
description: Keep working on a requested task through bounded work, root-cause diagnosis, verification, and retry iterations until explicit completion criteria are met or a maximum iteration limit is reached. Use for Ralph-style self-correction without requiring Claude plugins, Codex plugins, Gemini extensions, or hook support.

# Loop Until Done

## Dispatch

Use the tier, delivery boundary, and escalation rule for `loop-until-done` in `AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md`'s **Skill Model and Reasoning Routing** table, and resolve the tier through the active platform binding.

## Workflow

1. Read `.agents/prompts/loop-until-done.md` if present.
2. If the active environment provides a compatible built-in or installed bounded-loop workflow, prefer it while preserving the criteria and safety rules below; otherwise run this portable workflow directly.
3. Identify task, completion criteria, verification commands, and maximum iterations.
4. For each iteration:
   - Inspect current state.
   - For bugs or failures, prove the root cause before implementing a fix; avoid "it just worked" workarounds.
   - Make the smallest useful change.
   - Run verification.
   - Inspect diffs and status.
   - Continue only if the criteria remain unmet and the iteration limit is not reached.
5. Stop for cancellation, unsafe escalation, ambiguous completion, or satisfied criteria.

## Reporting

Report iterations used, changed files, root-cause evidence when applicable, verification evidence, satisfied criteria, and remaining risks.
